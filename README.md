# Analysis-of-Dropout-Phenomenon-in-Deep-Neural-Networks
The following project deals with the Analysis of the effects of dropouts on different parameters of Feed-Forward and Convolutional Neural Networks and derived relations between them. Proposed relation between Accuracy, Dropout rate, and Explainability of models using surrogate models.
